The test is designed to measure three types of ability: Numerical, Deductive, and Inductive. There are 30 questions in the test, with 10 questions for each of the three abilities measured. Sample tasks for jobs that may require these abilities include, but are not limited to: evaluating arguments, analyzing scenarios, working with data, doing mathematical computations, interpreting graphs and tables, and drawing logical conclusions. The G+ test, due to its adaptive nature, is appropriate for all job levels and roles."
Verify - General Ability Screen,https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-general-ability-screen/,Yes,Yes,10,"A,Remote,Testing","The General Ability Screen is a first for us – a measure of general mental ability or ‘g’ . Targeted at ‘entry-level’ roles, General Ability Screen is intended to precede other measures to provide process efficiency, and to ensure candidates experience the most positive possible assessment process, by being quick, fair and available as an online test 24/7/365. As the name suggests, the test is designed to be used in screening or sifting processes"
Verify - Inductive Reasoning (2014),https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-inductive-reasoning-2014/,Yes,Yes,24,"A,Remote,Testing","Inductive Reasoning is a test used for job candidates applying to jobs at all levels that require logical reasoning ability. Sample tasks for jobs that may require inductive reasoning include, but are not limited to dealing with new concepts and approaches, answering questions of ‘why’ and ‘how’ and resolving complex and ambiguous problems. Potential job titles that use this ability are Senior Sales, Product/Service Development, Research and Development."
Verify - Numerical Ability,https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-numerical-ability/,Yes,Yes,20,"A,Remote,Testing","The next-generation Verify Numerical Ability Test provides a replacement for the existing Numerical Reasoning test in our Verify range of ability tests and the Global Cognitive Index – Adaptive Quantitative test, and measures the ability to: • Derive the numerical problem from a written problem • Calculate the answer to numerical equations • Work with numerical data in a realistic workplace context The test is 20 minutes long, has 16 items and is designed to provide an indication of how an individual will perform when asked to work with numerical information or statistical details."
Verify - Technical Checking - Next Generation,https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-technical-checking-next-generation/,Yes,No,5,"A,Remote,Testing","The Technical Checking assessment is part of the Verify suite of cognitive ability assessments. Technical Checking measures perceptual speed and accuracy. This assessment requires examinees to quickly and accurately match symbols and switches based on a given set of rules. The Technical Checking assessment is mostly non-verbal and features shapes and figures. As with all assessments included in the Verify suite, the Technical Checking assessment allows organizations to assess this aspect of cognitive ability in an unproctored setting. This assessment is appropriate for all job levels and job titles, but is especially relevant for jobs that require the ability to quickly assess the accuracy of information against a set of rules."
Verify - Verbal Ability - Next Generation,https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-verbal-ability-next-generation/,Yes,Yes,15,"A,Remote,Testing","The Verbal Ability test measures the ability to read written passages and comprehend the text, interpret tone and author intent, identify main ideas, and predict author responses. Sample tasks for jobs that may require verbal ability include, but are not limited to: working with reports, correspondence, instructions, and research information. The Verbal Ability test, due to its adaptive nature, is appropriate for all job levels and roles."
Verify - Working with Information,https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-working-with-information/,Yes,No,10,"A,Remote,Testing",This test measures a candidate's ability to process information.

Verify G+ - Candidate Report,https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/view/verify-g-candidate-report/,Yes,No,N/A,"A,Remote,Testing","The SHL Verify G+ Ability Candidate Report provides the candidate with feedback on their Numerical, Deductive and Inductive Reasoning results. It does not include the overall score, as it is intended for feedback and developmental purposes. The report focuses on how the candidate can improve their abilities in each area (deductive, inductive, and numerical). Please note: language availability for the G+ Candidate Report is currently more limited than for the manger-facing G+ Ability Report."
